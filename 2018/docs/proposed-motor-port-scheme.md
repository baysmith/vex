Notes
=====

1. Motor ports 1 and 10 are two-wire ports.  They have built-in controllors so
   a controller cable is not needed.
2. There are two circuit breakers for the VEX motor ports: one for ports 1-5
   and another for ports 6-10.  Heavily used motors (such as drive motors, and
   the two arm motors) should be evenly distributed between these two
   sections.
3. Because we can't use extension cables, ports 1 and 10 should be motors that
   are always close to the Cortex, like drive motors.
4. See http://vexwiki.org/vex_robotics_platforms/vex_edr/cpu/cortex/motor_ports
   for more information.
