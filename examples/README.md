Examples
--------

This directory contains third-party code samples not written by the ESHS
students.  The ideal code sample will come from a known person or location, be
heavily commented, and contain something interesting that we might want to
draw inspiration from later.  Please provide as much information about the
sample as you can while you are committing them.

Since the VEX V5 brain uses radically different code (written in C++, no
less), make sure you put the example in the correct directory.
