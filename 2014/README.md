vex-2014
========

This is a collection of the code written by the teams of the El Segundo High School Robotics Club for the 2014 Vex Robotics Challenge.  Eventually, our hope is that the repository will expand to hold code for every future Robotics Club team, so students to see what other teams have built in years past and learn from their experience.

Each team will have its own folder in the repository.  (If you team's folder is missing, create it yourself.)  You are encouraged to commit not only your robot's source code there, but any other documents, photos, or files that your team has found useful for coordination or collaboration.

Please include a README.md in your team folder that describes your team's robot and how to operate it.
