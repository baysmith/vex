MOTOR AND PORT ASSIGNMENTS, 2019

3. `BackRightWheel`
4. `BackLeftWheel`
    These are the four holonomic drive motors.  They employ mecanum wheels.
5. `LeftIntake`
6. `RightIntake`
    These are the motors that power the paddled intake at the front of the robot.
8. `TrayPusher`
    This allows the stack of cubes to be carefully moved to a vertical position.
10. `IntakeLift`
    This motor physically lifts the intake off of the ground.
