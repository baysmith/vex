Port assignments
================
- Drive:
    - port 6 - front left
    - port 10 - front right
    - port 3 - back left
    - port 9 - back right
- Shooter subsystem:
    - port 11 - launcher left
    - port 13 - launcher right

Control scheme
==============
- axis 2 - right motors
- axis 3 - left motors
- button X (toggle) - launcher motors on/off
    - Right now you have to hold it down.  That's a bug; please fix it

Ports marked "possibly" need further testing.

- port 1 partially working
- port 2 (possibly)
- port 4 (possibly)
